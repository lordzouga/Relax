As a PC user, you are probably guilty of collecting files from people and keeping it haphazardly in any folder on your PC and then later lose track of where you kept the files or you are the type that would really like a neatly arranged PC with the mp3s going to the music folder and the movies going to the video folder or the compressed files going to a predefined archive folder but you are too lazy to enforce such a rule(people like me).
If you fall into any of the category above, you must try this software. It allows you to add the notorious folders where you normally drop the files "haphazardly" and to also add folders where you would prefer certain files to be like Music folder for mp3, m4a, ogg or any music format you use. Once you add the notorious folder and you add a file that is not meant to be there, it automatically whisks it away to the right folder immediately..
